Flutter provider quite an extensive guide on installation for different platforms: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). Choose your development environment and target device to get started. 

Here is a quick overview of the steps to run the project:

1. Make sure you are working with a system with a minimum of 8GB RAM, 4 core CPU, and enough free disk space. This is to ensure enough resources and speed when running the project locally.
2. You need to install Git for cloning the project and running some flutter commands. Here is the guide in case you need it: [Install Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
3. Android Studio for Windows and XCode for Mac is necessary to debug and compile code. CocoaPods are additionally required for iOS.
4. Download Flutter SDK and add it to the PATH. For Mac, CocoaPods is also required in the PATH.
5. Download the device emulators for Android/iOS to run the code locally.
6. Download your favorite IDE: VSCode or Cursor or Android Studio. I encourage you to try Cursor IDE. 

## Verify Installation

Whether you followed Windows/Mac setup, run `flutter doctor` to verify that flutter is set up correctly. Donâ€™t worry - everything may not be checked for you. It depends on the development environment you have chosen.

## Start with Flutter Dev Kit

1. Go to the directory where you want to place your project.
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mahima-manik/flutter-starter-kit.git
    cd flutter-starter-kit
    ```
    

2. To download all project dependencies listed in `pubspec.yaml`, run this:
    
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
    
    Notice it will generate `build/` folder in the project root directory

3. Select a device from the bottom-right corner of your VSCode editor. 
    
    <Image src={deviceSelect} alt="Flutter Devices" />

4. Add environment variables in `assets/.env` file.
    ```
    STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_complete_it
    STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_complete_it
    MERCHANT_NAME="Your Merchant Name"
    RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key
    SENDER_EMAIL_ADDRESS=your_email@email.com
    ```

    If you skip this step, you will see an error like this:
    ```   
    Launching lib/main.dart on Chrome in debug mode...
    Error detected in pubspec.yaml:
    No file or variants found for asset: assets/.env.

    Failed to compile application.

    Exited (1).
    ```

5. Go to `lib/main.dart`, you will see a debug and run button on the top-right corner of the IDE. It performs the build, installs, and runs the application on the selected device.
    
    <Image src={runButton} alt="Run button on top-right" />
    
    Run button on top-right
    
    Or you can run using the command: 
    
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    
    > Note: This may take few minutes to build and run for the first time.

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³Â You have successfully run the project! Now we will make it feature-rich step by step.
