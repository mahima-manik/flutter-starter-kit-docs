import productDocument from '../../../assets/product-document.png';
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

In this project, we store all the product related information in the `products` collection. 

## Add product info
Go to Firestore - create a "products" collection if you don't already have one. In the products collection, create a new document for each product. Document ID can be auto generated by Firestore using "auto ID" option.

<Image src={productDocument} alt="Product Document" />

## Add product images
Copy the "document ID" of the product document you just created on Firestore
Go to Firebase Storage -> products -> create a folder with the same name as the document ID. Add all the product images to this folder.

When we display product details, we will display the images from this Firebase Storage folder. So, it is important to keep the folder name same as the product document ID.

## Product Model
Model for the product is defined in `models/product.dart`.

```dart
  Product({
    required this.id,
    required this.name, 
    required this.description, 
    required this.price, 
    this.rating = 0.0,
    List<String>? images
  }) : images = images ?? ['assets/images/default_product_image.png'];
```

You can add/remove the fields required as per your application requirements.
