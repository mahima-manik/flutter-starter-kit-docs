Firebase offers a variety of storage options for Flutter apps. The most commonly used are Firebase Storage and Cloud Firestore.

  **Firebase Storage:** Used for storing files (mostly user-generated) which can be images, videos, audio, and more. They are usually not changed often.

  **Cloud Firestore:** Used for storing structured data which can be used to create a NoSQL database.

## Cloud Firestore
You need to follow steps <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#dart" target="_blank">here</a> to get started. You should create Cloud Firestore in Firebase Console first.

We use Cloud Firestore to store product's information. It is parsed in product model in the code.

Pay attention to Cloud Firestore rules. Here is the one to allow read operation for everyone:
```json
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

## Firebase Storage

It is a storage service used to store and retrieve user generated content. They are generally used to store big blobs of data that don't change often like photos, audio, videos, docs, etc.

Go to Firebase console -> Build -> Storage -> Get Started. Choose Test mode for starters and cloud storage location (preferably near your location). Note: storage location cannot be changed after creation.

For the purpose of this project, we will be using Firebase Storage to store user uploaded profile images and product images

<Card title="Upload locations">
  **Profile pictues:** Used for storing user uploaded profile images. `user_uploads/profile/$userId/$imageName.$fileExtension`

  **Product images:** Used for storing product images. It is stored in `products/$productId/$imageName.$fileExtension`
</Card>
