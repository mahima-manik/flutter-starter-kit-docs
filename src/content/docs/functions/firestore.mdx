Firebase offers a variety of storage options for Flutter apps. The most commonly used are Firebase Storage and Cloud Firestore.

- Firebase Storage: Used for storing files (mostly user-generated) which can be images, videos, audio, and more. They are usually not changed often.
- Cloud Firestore: Used for storing structured data which can be used to create a NoSQL database.

## Cloud Firestore
You need to follow steps [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#dart) to get started. You should create Cloud Firestore in Firebase Console first.

We use Cloud Firestore to store product's information. It is parsed in product model in the code.

Pay attention to Cloud Firestore rules. Here is the one to allow read operation for everyone:
```json
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if true;
    }
  }
}
```
