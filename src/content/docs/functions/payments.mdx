The `PaymentService` class handles the Stripe payment integration. It includes methods to create a customer, generate a payment intent, and initialize and present the payment sheet.

## Display 

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    <Image src={paymentSheet} style={{ maxWidth: '48%' }} alt="Payment Sheet" />
    <Image src={orderConfirmLight} style={{ maxWidth: '48%' }} alt="Order Confirmation" />
</div>

## Prerequisites
1. Create a Stripe account [here](https://stripe.com/)
2. Turn ON test mode
    <Image src={stripeTestMode} alt="Stripe Test mode" />
3. Go to `Developers` -> `API Keys`. Copy the `Secret Key` and `Publishable Key`.
4. Populate these values in `assets/.env` file for `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`.

## Steps

`flutter_stripe` library is used to handle payments. Steps in the documentation were followed <a href="https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_stripe" target="_blank">here</a>. It's already included in the project. 
```dart
await dotenv.load(fileName: "assets/.env");
Stripe.publishableKey = dotenv.get('STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY');
```
`dotenv` package is used to load environment variables from `.env` file.

`http` package is used to send requests to Stripe API, like `createCustomer`, `createPaymentIntent`, etc.

### Regulatory requirements in India

For accepting international payments mandante sending following fields:
- `buyer's name`
- `billing address`
- `description` of the product/service
- `shipping address` if shipping is required

We supply these parameters to Stripe in `_createStripeCustomer` method and the customerID created is used to create a payment intent.

**Note:** If the buyer’s name, billing address, shipping address or description isn’t provided, the payment will fail.

More information on regulatory requirements in India can be found <a href="https://docs.stripe.com/india-accept-international-payments" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://support.stripe.com/questions/accepting-international-payments-from-stripe-accounts-in-india" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Security
To ensure the security of payment processing, it is recommended to handle sensitive operations, such as creating payment intents, on the backend. This approach helps to protect your API keys and other sensitive information from being exposed.

In this project, the payment intent is created in the `payment_service.dart` file. However, for a more secure implementation, consider moving this logic to a backend service. This backend service can then communicate with the Stripe API and return the necessary information to your frontend application.
