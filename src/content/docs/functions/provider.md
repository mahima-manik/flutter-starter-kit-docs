State management refers to the way you manage the state of your application. It is required to share data across different parts of the app. In Flutter, state management is crucial because it helps you manage the state of your widgets and ensures that your UI updates in response to state changes.

## Provider Package
The Provider package is a popular state management solution in Flutter. It allows you to manage and propagate state across your application efficiently. It uses the ChangeNotifier class to notify listeners about state changes, which then rebuilds the UI accordingly.
