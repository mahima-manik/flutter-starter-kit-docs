This documentation provides an overview of how Firebase Authentication and Google Sign-In are integrated into the app. It covers the setup on the Firebase portal, the AuthService class, the UserAuthProvider class, and the profile update and login/logout functionalities.

## Firebase Setup
Firebase offers multiple authentication methods. Enable Email/Password and Google provider sign in to get started.
<Image src={authOptions} alt="Authentication Options" />
    
1. In the Firebase console's **Authentication** section, open the [Sign in method](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/authentication/providers) page.
2. From the **Sign in method** page, enable the **Email/password sign-in** method and click **Save**.
    <Image src={emailPass} alt="Email/Password Sign-In" />
3. Enable Google signin and provide your support email. Save and proceed.    
    <Image src={gSignin} alt="Google Sign-In" />
    
    `google_sign_in` package is used in Flutter to enable authentication. For authentication on IOS device, you need to follow the steps here: https://pub.dev/packages/google_sign_in_ios#ios-integration. 
    
    You should see authentication setup something like this:

## AuthService Class
The AuthService class handles all authentication-related operations, including sign-in, sign-out, registration, and profile updates.

#### Key Methods
- **Auth State Changes:** This stream notifies listeners about changes in the user's authentication state (e.g., sign-in, sign-out).
    ```dart
    Stream<User?> get authStateChanges => _auth.authStateChanges();
    ```
- **User Changes:** This stream notifies listeners about changes to the user's profile information.
    ```dart
    Stream<User?> get userChanges => _auth.userChanges();
    ```
- Sign In with Email and Password
- Google Sign-In
- Sign Out
- Update Display Name
- Update User Photo
- Update Password

#### Design
The `UserAuthProvider` class extends `ChangeNotifier` and manages the user's authentication state. It listens to authentication state changes and user profile changes, updating its internal state and notifying listeners accordingly. 

`UserAuthProvider` contains instance of `AuthService` to interact with Firebase Authentication. The constructor sets up listeners for authentication state changes and user profile changes. When these events occur, the `_onAuthUserChanged` method is called.
```dart
UserAuthProvider() {
    _authService.authStateChanges.listen(_onAuthUserChanged);
    _authService.userChanges.listen(_onAuthUserChanged);
  }

  void _onAuthUserChanged(User? user) {
    _user = user;
    notifyListeners();
  }
```
- The provider centralizes the authentication state, ensuring that all parts of the app have a consistent view of the user's authentication status.
- By using a provider, the authentication logic is decoupled from the UI components. This separation makes the code more modular, easier to maintain, and testable.
