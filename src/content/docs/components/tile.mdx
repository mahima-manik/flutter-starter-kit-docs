The `ExpandableTextTile` widget displays a tile that can expand and collapse to show or hide additional text. It includes a title, an optional icon, and a toggle to show more or less text.

## Display
<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between', alignItems: 'center' }}>
    <Image src={tileLight} style={{ maxWidth: '48%' }} alt="Tile" />
    <Image src={tileDark} style={{ maxWidth: '48%' }} alt="Tile" />
</div>


## Features
- **Expandable and Collapsible Text**: The widget allows users to expand and collapse the text by clicking "show more" or "show less". It is styled with a blue color to indicate that it is clickable.
- **Customizable Icon**: An optional icon can be displayed next to the text.
- **Automatic Text Overflow Handling**: The widget automatically handles text overflow and displays an ellipsis if the text exceeds the maximum lines when collapsed. This is achieved using `StatefulBuilder`
- **Tile Padding**: The tile padding is set to `EdgeInsets.only(left: 0, right: 15)` by default.
- **Control Affinity**: The control affinity is set to `ListTileControlAffinity.trailing` by default.
- **Initial Expansion State**: The tile is initially collapsed (`initiallyExpanded: false`).

## Usage
Import `ExpandableTextTile` in any page to display a tile with expandable text. It takes the following parameters:
- `title`: A string representing the title of the tile.
- `text`: A string representing the text to display within the tile.
- `icon`: (Optional) An `IconData` to display an icon next to the text. The default icon is `Icons.info_outline`.
